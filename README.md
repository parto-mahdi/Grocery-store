Implementing a grocery store management system

In this project, I implemented a grocery store management system.

I wrote a class to represent a product in a grocery store. The product is characterized by three properties, the name, the price and a unique barcode id. A grocery store can have multiple pieces of the same product. Create another 2 classes, one representing a client and another representing a basket. The basket can contain multiple products and is associated with a client. Add methods that will allow to:
•	add an item (a piece of a product) into the basket
•	remove an item from the basket
•	print all products that are in a basket
